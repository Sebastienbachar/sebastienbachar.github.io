          <p>About an hour and a half into the trip, it had gotten dark. They had about three hours left in the ride, so Patricia thought she would get a little rest, and she laid her head against the car door. When she woke awhile later, Joshua said there was only about an hour left. She re-positioned herself upright and turned on the radio, but all of the stations were static. </p>
            
          <p>Then, all of a sudden, the station started changing on its own.  </p>
            
          <p>Joshua and Patricia looked at the radio dial in disbelief. Then, out of nowhere, came a blinding light, so bright they couldn’t see a thing. Joshua slammed on the brakes, and they came screeching to a halt. The light seemed like it was getting closer, until it filled the entire truck.  </p>
            
          <p>Everything went black.  </p>
            
          <p>Patricia woke up with a surging headache. She found herself in a small, dark room, trapped in a cage made out of what seemed to be bones. She then spotted Joshua nearby, bare naked—and chained up against the wall by his arms and legs. </p>

          <p>She sat there for a short while, terrified, when a tall, yet slouched beast appeared from the corridor. It stayed motionless for a moment, looked around, then walked over to her cage. It had a dirty matted coat of brown fur, its eyes were huge and black, and its nose, just two small holes.  </p>
           
          <p>It opened its mouth, revealing sharp, yellow fangs. It approached Patricia, slowly brought its hand up towards her head, and ran its ragged, long nails across the cage between them. An ominous “clack” startled her, every time the beast’s nail hit the next bone. Patricia was trembling with fear. But then it receded from her cage and proceeded towards Joshua.  </p>
           
          <p>By then, Joshua was awake.   He followed the beast with his eyes as it moved closer and closer to him. Joshua screamed “HELP!”—again and again and again—at the top of his lungs.  He kicked and pulled the chains around his limbs, and yelled even louder. </p>
           
            <p>Quick as lightning, the beast screeched and flung its hand around and into Joshua’s throat. <em>[To be continued...]</em>  </p>
