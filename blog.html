          <p>I've been working on some creative writing lately, and new drawings and prints.  I've always loved stories, and also illustrating my stories in photography and film.  Watch this space for my next projects!></p>

          <p>I've decided to translate my photo storybook "Night" into a short film, so am now working on composing a companion soundtrack in GarageBand to add to the horror story atmosphere. </p>

          <h1>Night</h1>
          <p>Patricia was a fifteen year-old girl at Oakville High. Several months earlier, she had met a very nice young man named Joshua. They decided that over the weekend, they would go to Joshua’s parents’ ranch up near the mountains. </p>
          <p>Patricia thought they should leave on Friday night so they would have all of Saturday and Sunday to be with each other. On Friday, both Patricia and Joshua endured their long and boring classes. They both felt like the classes would never end!  Finally it had reached the end of the day, and the final bell rang. </p>
          <p>When she saw Joshua in the school hallway, she ran to him and gave him a big hug. She was extremely excited for their trip—and so was he. They both climbed into Joshua’s pick-up truck. Patricia reminded Joshua that they needed to make a quick stop at her house to pick up her bag. (To be continued...)</p>
